      "question": "What is the purpose of key expansion in the AES decryption process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To add an additional layer of security",
        "b": "To generate a set of round keys for subsequent decryption rounds",
        "c": "To increase the size of the original encryption key",
        "d": "To mix the columns of the state"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Key expansion focuses on creating round keys rather than adding security layers.",
        "b": "Correct. Key expansion generates round keys for subsequent decryption rounds.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Key expansion does not increase the size of the original encryption key.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Mixing columns is part of the Inverse MixColumns operation, not key expansion."

      "question": "In the initial round of AES decryption, what is added to the ciphertext?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The first round key",
        "b": "The last round key",
        "c": "The expanded key",
        "d": "The MixColumns operation result"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial round adds the last round key, not the first.",
        "b": "Correct. The last round key is added to the ciphertext in the initial round of decryption.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The expanded key is used in key expansion, not added to the ciphertext.",
        "d": "Incorrect. MixColumns is not added in the initial round but performed in the Inverse MixColumns operation."

      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Inverse MixColumns operation in the AES decryption process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To mix the columns of the state using a fixed matrix",
        "b": "To shift the rows of the state to the right",
        "c": "To replace each byte of the state with its inverse in the S-box",
        "d": "To XOR the round key with the state"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Inverse MixColumns reverses the MixColumns operation, mixing columns with the inverse of the fixed matrix.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Shifting rows to the right is part of the Inverse ShiftRows operation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Inverse MixColumns does not involve the S-box; that is part of Inverse SubBytes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. XORing the round key with the state is part of the AddRoundKey operation."
