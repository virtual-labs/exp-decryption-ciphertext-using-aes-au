      "question": "How many rounds of the inverse round transformation are performed during AES decryption with a 192-bit key?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "8 rounds",
        "b": "10 rounds",
        "c": "12 rounds",
        "d": "14 rounds"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The number of rounds for 192-bit key decryption is not 8.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The correct number of rounds for 192-bit key decryption is not 10.",
        "c": "Correct. AES decryption with a 192-bit key involves 12 rounds of the inverse round transformation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The number of rounds for 192-bit key decryption is not 14."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the Final Round in the AES decryption process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To generate the initial round key",
        "b": "To perform the Inverse MixColumns operation",
        "c": "To apply the Inverse ShiftRows transformation",
        "d": "To complete the decryption by adding the final round key"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial round key is generated during key expansion, not the Final Round.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Inverse MixColumns is part of the inverse round transformation, not the Final Round.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The Inverse ShiftRows transformation is part of the inverse round transformation.",
        "d": "Correct. The Final Round involves Inverse SubBytes, Inverse ShiftRows, and adding the round key to complete decryption."
